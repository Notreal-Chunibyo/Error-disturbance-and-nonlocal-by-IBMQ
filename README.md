# EDR Quantum Circuit Research Project

This Jupyter Notebook is designed for a quantum computing research project, arXiv:2311.00303 (2023).


## Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook is used for a quantum computing research project, specifically for the construction and simulation of EDR (Error-Disturbance Relationship) circuits, as detailed in the paper arXiv:2311.00303 (2023).

## Content Structure

The Notebook contains the following sections:

### Import Libraries and Setup

- Import necessary Python libraries (NumPy, Qiskit, Matplotlib).
- Set global parameters.

### Circuit Construction and Simulation

- Construct EDR circuits using Qiskit.
- Simulate the circuits and collect results.

### Data Analysis and Visualization

- Perform data analysis on the simulation results.
- Visualize the results using tools.

## Environment Setup

This Notebook requires the following environment and dependencies:

- Python version: 3.9
- Main dependencies: NumPy, Qiskit, Matplotlib, etc.

### Installation
